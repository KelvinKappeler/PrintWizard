# Levels of Granularity

## Overview

The granularity of the source code trace refers to the level of detail at which the trace is displayed.
The granularity of the trace can be adjusted to show more or less information about the source code.
For example, do we need to show the entire body of a while loop, or just the condition of the loop?

## Implementation 1 : Triangles

The trace will be displayed using triangles to represent the different levels of granularity.
Each triangle will represent a different level of detail in the source code.
The user can click on a triangle to expand or collapse the trace at that level of granularity.

## Implementation 2 : Zoom In/Out

The user can enter into a specific function or loop to see more details about the source code.
The user will be able to only see the source code of the selected function or loop.
The user can zoom out to see the source code of the entire trace, or return to the previous level of granularity.

## Implementation 3 : Slider

The user can adjust the level of granularity using a slider.
The slider will allow the user to increase or decrease the level of detail in the source code.
The user can slide the slider to the right to see more details about the source code, or slide the slider to the left to see less details about the source code.
